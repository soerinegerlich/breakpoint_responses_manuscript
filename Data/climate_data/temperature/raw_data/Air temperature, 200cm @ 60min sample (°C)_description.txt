ClimateBasis Zackenberg - Air temperature - Air temperature, 200cm @ 60min sample (°C)
Location: Climate Stations lat: 74.47188568115234 lon: -20.552244186401367 accuracy: Specific named location
Air temperature measured on two proximal climate stations at 200 cm above ground as a 60min sample (°C). The double masted climate station is located north of the station at 44 m a.s.l.. The timeseries starts in 1995. Quality control is performed on both datasets from the double mast system. The combined time series is calculated as an average of the 2 sensors, or if data is missing from 1 sensor the other used in conjunction with a regression. Please read the metadata file provided with the data for comments related to the data in this timeseries.    Air temperature:Air temperature    ClimateBasis Zackenberg:The ClimateBasis programme monitors climate and hydrology in Zackenberg, Kobbefjord and Disko (Qeqertarsuaq) and is run by Asiaq - Greenland Survey. The collected data build base-line information on climate variability and trends for all the other sub-programmes within GEM and serve as a trustworthy foundation for adaptation strategies for the Greenlandic society. The stations are embedded in Asiaq’s extensive climate and hydrology monitoring network. Furthermore, the run-off data is delivered to the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS) and the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) networks.
