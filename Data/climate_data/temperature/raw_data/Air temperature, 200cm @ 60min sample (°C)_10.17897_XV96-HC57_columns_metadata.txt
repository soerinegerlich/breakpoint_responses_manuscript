Quality Flag	"Flag assigned during quality control. Flag = ""fair"" is assigned instead of good to indicate where a value is interpolated, or, where only 1 timeseries has been used where it is normal to take the average of 2 timeseries. Flag = unknown is equivalent to the flag ""good"" or ""fair"" and is due a change in proceedures. Work is underway to update these flags."		Text
